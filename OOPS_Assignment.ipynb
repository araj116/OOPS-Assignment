        "#The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "#1. **Encapsulation**: This principle involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It also restricts direct access to some of the object’s components, which helps protect the integrity of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#2. **Abstraction**: Abstraction simplifies complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors of objects. It allows programmers to focus on high-level functionalities while hiding the complex implementation details.\n",
        "\n",
        "#3. **Inheritance**: This concept allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#4. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows for methods to be defined in multiple ways, enabling one interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).\n",
        "\n",
        "#5. **Composition**: While sometimes considered an aspect of encapsulation, composition is the principle of building complex objects by combining simpler objects or components. It promotes flexibility and code reuse by allowing objects to be composed of other objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "#These concepts work together to facilitate better code organization, flexibility, and maintainability in software development."

        "\n",
        "#**Method Resolution Order (MRO)** in Python is the order in which base classes are looked up when searching for a method in a class hierarchy. This is particularly important in cases of multiple inheritance, where a class might inherit from multiple base classes. Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm (also known as C3 superclass linearization) to determine the MRO, ensuring that the order is consistent and follows specific rules.\n",
